### **Voxel Engine:**

**1.** Block-crafting games rely on a voxel engine to represent the 3D world as a grid of cubes.

**2.** Creating manageable sections of the world for efficient loading and rendering depends on RAM size.

**3.** Generating landscapes and terrain automatically using algorithms like Simplex noise.

**4.** Removing unnecessary faces and grouping visible faces of blocks to improve rendering performance.

**5.** Implementing systems to detect when players or objects collide with blocks.

**6.** Simulating light and shadows within the voxel world.

### **Java Game Libraries:**

**1.** This open-source library provides additional primitives, composite objects, controls, and data visualizations that go beyond the basic JavaFX 3D packages. FXyz3D also offers importers for common 3D formats like OBJ, STL, and Maya.

**2.** Optimize memory allocation and deallocation to prevent leaks and improve performance. Tools like Java Flight Recorder and Java Mission Control can help identify memory issues.

**3.** Organize your 3D objects using JavaFX's scene graph, ensuring efficient management of your blocks within the 3D environment.

## **Prerequisites:**

- **JDK 21 or later version:** This is a Long-Term Support (LTS) version, meaning it receives extended support and updates, making it a stable choice for projects requiring longevity. It requires JDK 21 or later.
  
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA is a popular choice for JavaFX development due to its features and integration. Other options include Eclipse and NetBeans.

- **Scene Builder:** Utilize Scene Builder for visual UI design, allowing drag-and-drop component placement and FXML generation.

- **MVC Pattern** Enforce a Model-View-Controller (MVC) or similar architectural pattern (e.g., MVCI) to separate concerns and improve maintainability, especially when using FXML.
  
- **FXML:** Leverage FXML for defining your UI layouts, separating the UI definition from the Java code.

- **Package:** Organize your code with clear and logical package names (e.g., controllers, services, views).

- **3D Engine:** Use LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library) or jMonkeyEngine.
